class Song

  #parse a filename to find the song name and artist name.
  # # # note - every filename is separated by " - "


  #create a new song instance using the string we gather from filename


  #associate the new song with an artist.
  # # # note - use helper method: artist_name=(artist_name)
  #this method should takes in the name and gets the artist object

  #return the new song instance
